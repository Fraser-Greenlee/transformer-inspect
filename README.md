# transformer-inspect

Understand &amp; simplify reasoning in transformers.

The plan here is to inspect how gpt2 hidden states handle mathematical reasoning.

I plan to first learn sparse activations then to approximate these activations with a program.

Hopefully the final program will be smaller & more generalisable than the gpt model.
